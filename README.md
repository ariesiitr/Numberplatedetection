## Introduction

Number plate detection plays a crucial role in various applications, such as automatic toll collection, traffic surveillance, and vehicle tracking. This project focuses on using OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library, to detect and extract number plates from images. The algorithm implemented in this project utilizes image processing techniques to locate and isolate the number plates accurately.

## Installation

To use this code, you need to have Python 3 and OpenCV installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/numberplate-detection.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd numberplate-detection
```

3. Install the required Python dependencies using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the code:

```
python detect_numberplate.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```

## Usage

To detect number plates in an image, you can use the `detect_numberplate.py` script. It takes the path to an input image as a command-line argument and outputs the image with the detected number plate highlighted.

```
python detect_numberplate.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```

Replace `path/to/image.jpg` with the actual path to your image file. The output image will be saved as `output.jpg` in the project directory.

## Algorithm

The number plate detection algorithm consists of the following steps:

1. **Image Preprocessing**: The input image is converted to grayscale and then blurred to reduce noise.

2. **Edge Detection**: The Canny edge detection algorithm is applied to detect edges in the image.

3. **Contours Extraction**: The contours of the detected edges are extracted using OpenCV's `findContours` function.

4. **Number Plate Localization**: The algorithm applies various filtering techniques to identify the region of interest (ROI) containing the number plate.

5. **Number Plate Extraction**: The number plate is extracted from the ROI and saved as a separate image.

For a detailed explanation of the algorithm, please refer to the code comments in `detect_numberplate.py`.
